It's been 2 years since I joined [SolidLogix](https://solidlogix.com) and I have to say this is experience gets more exciting through time. I'm not the same persona and professional since I started working for this company, and definitely,
I'm not the same person that I was a year ago.

We'll agree this year has been a very tough one, a lot of changes,
a lot of things we had taken for granted are any longer the way they were. Working in technology has taught me that I'm not supposed to stay in the same place (knowledge, goals, failures, victories) as usual,
but being hit by events that are out of my control it's harder.

All the things we cannot take control of, we can't fix them, but we can manage the way we face them, the way we stand-ups for ourselves.
A lot of expectation we had didn't get the chance to fulfill, but there is a lot of things to be grateful,
working for a remote company you expect to get the opportunity to know them better, to share some experience,
and connect with the team.

Hopefully, we got that opportunity before this crisis started, and it was a really good
experience to share with some of the members.

We went through a lot of changes, we learned so many technical and soft skills down the road,
and I'm sure if you read my first post, one year ago, you saw the technical skills that wanted to show off at that moment,
but this year, it's been quite the opposite, I wanted to give a human touch on this post.

I have connected more with some of my co-workers, and that's something that I'm proud of,
that helped us to share our experiences and support each other. I'm so grateful to have a job during
this crisis and I hope the next year be better for all of us,
in the meantime never stop learning and sharing with your peers, it's a bigger victory when all the team grows too.
