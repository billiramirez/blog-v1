We all have different ways of keeping up to date with the latest news and announcements in the tech industry, but there's some
stuff that is based on the experience, and for that, you need to be able to connect to the people and let them share with you
how they accomplished something that's interesting to you.

The podcast format is an audio format ready to consume over the internet, you can search for your preferences such as music, art,
cook, sports, tech, etc. So even if you have a nontrivial hobby, you're likely to find a Podcast Show that covers that field.
A huge benefit of podcasts is the ability to consume that content at the moment you want, in the car, while you're washing
your dishes, working out, cleaning your house, etc. So the time you set for those activities would a good match for
listening to your favorites podcast show.

## How a Tech Podcast is Different from any other Source of Content?

As we said previously, this is content to consume when you're doing some other stuff, so you don't have to block off some of your
time in order to listen to the shows. As a developer, we're always trying to keep up with the technologies, tools, and news in
this field, but you don't have always the knowledge of experience, that's an invaluable asset for the Community, we can learn
a lot from the experiences, some of them you can't find them in a book or a dev forum, you're likely to hear them from the
people, in a conference break, or having a cup of tea.

Those experiences deserve to be listened to or shared, this is where the podcast comes in, [Devs Nicaragua Podcast](https://anchor.fm/devsnicaragua) is intented to
have talented people on the show, willing to answers some questions, or talking about some work they've been doing is a great way
of learning, for all of us. I have so many questions related to experiences too, so having an expert in that field is a huge opportunity,
I've always had some questions, like **_how to get hired in tech?_** or **how to get a job as a freelancer?** or **how to create community?** etc.
This is the right place to throw all those questions and let the other people get that benefit too.

## Why an Spanish Podcast?

I live in Nicaragua, and there are a lot of talented people here, which are working for some companies abroad, and this usually means they're ahead
of the latest tech and knowledge from the local companies. Not all the developers in our community speak English, but having the goodwill of the
people who do, will help us all, we can share our knowledge and boost our country with the digital economy, being all on the same page is
definitely good for all.

I'm subscribed to some english podcast, and there's some topics that are worthwhile to discuss it, so taking down that barrier of the language will
helps us to keep on track.

## Be a Good Host

You need to be respectful with all your invites, with their time, make sure to take only the time you need for the episode, they're busy on their daily
basis, so, avoid the spam and try to facilitate everything for them, don't forget you're the host, make them feel comfortable the process. While you're
recording make sure to let them know this is a usual talk you would have in a coffee shop, or sharing a beer, the only difference is it will be recorded.

Having the ability to connect with your invites and audience, allows you to get them on board in future episodes, always ask for feedback to iterate over it,
and improve the quality of your podcast. If you want to listen to to our podcast we'll put the links below so you can give it a try.
